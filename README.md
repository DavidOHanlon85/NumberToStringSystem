<h1>Months of the Year</h1>

As a user I want to be able to pass a month value 1-12 into the system and be returned as a string the name of the month. E.g. 7 = July‚Äù

Write a Java program to implement this functionality.

You should use a switch statement.

Test all possible code paths with JUnit Test cases.

Default return (invalid number passed into the function) has been agreed to be a Number Format Exception.
